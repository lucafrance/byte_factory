- 32 general‑purpose registers  
- 64 kB RAM  
- 128 kB hard drive  
- Interrupt handler  
- ~700 Hz frequency  
- Peripherals  
  - ASCII character display  
  - Color display  
  - Keyboard  
  - RNG

# Assembler Installation
- We recommend the `uv` [Python Environment manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/). Once installed, use `uv sync` to get the python environment. 

# CPU Installation
- You need Factorio (main game, not the Space Age expansion). You can get it [from the developer](https://www.factorio.com/buy), on [Good Old Games](https://www.gog.com/en/game/factorio), or on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/).

- Place the save file `factoriscoV3_official.zip` (from the main folder of this repository) into your saves folder. You can find the folder using [this](https://wiki.factorio.com/Application_directory) article.
- Open Factorio and load the world. Confirm to load the needed mods.
- You should be in the map editor (window top right corner, and missing character). If not, enter the map editor by pressing `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `F11` in-game.
- It is recommended to add the UPS counter by pressing `F4` to open the Debug Settings and enable `show-fps`
- Change the simulation speed up to 64x by checking out the Time tab of the map editor
- Standard speed has 60 UPS, so 64x can have up to 3700 UPS. However, most laptops will not reach that, and should be areound 700-1000 UPS. Try out 16x or 32x speed up for better scrolling experience (if you speed up by 64x and your machine does not support that, scrolling in the world becomes very slow)
- If the clouds are going crazy, disable them in the main settings (`Esc` > `Settings`> `Graphics` > `Show clouds`)
- You need to set a control in order to work with the Pushbuttons mod (used for the buttons from the keyboard). For that, go to `Esc` > `Settings` > `Controls` and search for `Toggle Entity`. It should be in the `Debug` category. Set the key of that for example to the middle mouse button or the `.` key.
- Then, find the power button in the top right corner of the user display (next to the display). Hit the power button using the key you set in the last step. The terminal should appear
- For a debug program, enter `R0` in the editor using the keyboard of the CPU (and press one of the 3 buttons symbolizing the `Enter` key).
- It should print 10 Fibonacci numbers, starting from 2.
- There are already some example programs on the hard drive. Try out `RUN /BIN/MINE` for Minesweeper or `RUN /BIN/SNAKE` for Snake.
- Next Section covers all the commands you can enter in the terminal.

# FactOS: Command Line Interface
The command line interface called `FactOS` is attached to the file system `Chest32`. Currently, there is no current working directory, instead you have to enter always the absolute path to a file or a folder.
Pay attention to the syntax, they are a bit quirky... (TODO: Make better syntax)

`FactOS`has currently the following commands implemented:
- `CLS`: Clears the screen
- `R0`: Runs the program currently loaded in ROM 0
- `R1`: Runs the program currently loaded in Rom 1
- `LS <path>`: List the contents of a folder. Example: `LS /BIN` or `LS /` (for the root folder, the single `/` is mandatory)
- `MKDIR <path> <folder name>`: Creates a folder in the given folder path with name `<folder name>`. Max. 8 chars are allowed for a folder name. Example: `MKDIR / test` creates a test folder in the root dir.
- `TOUCH <path> <file name>`: Same as MKDIR, but creates an empty file instead. Example: `TOUCH /BIN EXAMPLE` creates a file `/BIN/EXAMPLE`
- `CPROM <ROM index> <file name>`: Copies the content of the User Rom to a file. the File must exist (use `TOUCH` for that). Example: `CPROM 0 /BIN/EXAMPLE`
- `RUN <path>`: Executes the program given by the path. Example: `RUN /BIN/EXAMPLE`
- `RM <path>`: Removes a file or a directory. The directory must be empty to remove it. Currently, there is no recursive mode implemented. Example: `RM /BIN/EXAMPLE`
- `FSINIT`: Formats the complete file system. The CPU will stop working and you have to restart the computer (power on -> power off).

# How to use the Assembler
You need to write an assembler program. An example is given in `factosico_v_assembly/fib_5.s` in this repository. The CPU uses mainly the RISC-V ISA, a (not the best documented, TODO) spreadsheet of the ISA is here:
[ISA Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yiPG3cVLzHdQ5oheNkY_mfr2utxFd6-CcddI-NiuWIM/edit?usp=sharing)

However, an overview of the assembly language is planned (TODO).

Once you have an assembly program, you can assemble it using the `factorisco_assembler/assembler.py` script. For that, update the script by giving the file name of your program (inside the `factorisco_v_assembly` folder, without the .s extension)
Example:
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    verbose = False
    user_program("fib_5", verbose=verbose)
```
Then, run the assembler from the root directory of this repo:
```
python factorisco_assembler/assembler.py
```
TODO: better command line interface for the assembler

The assembler should print out a long string of the "Data Blueprint".
Copy that string (you can mark the whole line by clicking 3 times on it for most editors).

Then, open Factorio and press the "Import String" button in the bottom row:
![docs/import_string.png](docs/import_string.png)

Paste the copied string. A column of constant combinators should be loaded.
Insert them either as the left column of ROM 0 or ROM 1.

Then, you can run the program by entering R0 or R1 inside the CPU terminal.
